<h4 align="center">Simultaneous estimation of single-molecular position and orientation with ultra-high precision</h4>

## Introduction
As an variant of [MINFLUX](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aak9913), this method enables the simultaneous estimation of the position and orientation of a single molecule with ultra-high precision.

The datasets and part of the code are provided here. For some privacy reasons, the code for the Debye diffraction integral is not open-sourced for now, and an approximate expression (numCal.m) is used instead.

## Environment
This code has been tested on:
- MATLAB R2020b on Windows 10
- MATLAB R2019b on Windows 7
